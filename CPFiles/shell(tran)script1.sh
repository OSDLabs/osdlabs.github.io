# welcome to the first video by osd labs
# in this video i shall try to cover some basic commands, which are very important in life
#diving in.
#command : date
# just type date, like so:
date
#it told you the date, see!
#command: who
# who is supposed to tell you the users who are logged in. its almost always 2 people. I have never understood why, and what that means
who
# to figure out which you are, type "who am i" instead.
# this next command is more useful. it displays (prints) a calendar
# command : cal
cal
# lastly, lets see if there is some way to avoid remembering the usage of each command.
# it is unavoidable to have to remember the command
# you can use "man" to do this. just type man, followed by the command name
man cal
# man, stands for manual, and the word you type after that, is the manual you wish to see.
# enter 'q' anytime to exit the manual.
# happy shellscripting! see you in our next video!
